Local Zoo
During your free time you've decided to volunteer at your local zoo! It's been fun mucking out boar enclosures and not falling into the shark tank, but the assistant director has approached you and asked for your help in a different area.

The Zoo's animal tracking software's license has expired, and they're fed up with paying expensive licensing fees for an application that doesn't work very well. Besides just being generally user-unfriendly, the previous app didn't allow zoo workers to track the animals' likes and dislikes, or how many caretakers each requires.

You've agreed to use your web development skills to help out! Plan and create an application to track animals at your local Zoo. A senior developer will review your work -- and they are interested in hiring! Before you begin, take some time to map out a plan - what features do you definitely want to implement, which can wait until you're approved for a larger project? Make sure to record your ambitions in your README.

Requirements

Users (zoo staff), should be able to add newly-admitted animals to the app.


As a userâ€¦

I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
I want to view a list of animals I have logged.
I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older).
I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.
If you have completed all basic objectives and thoroughly tested your app, consider additional features such as:

Extend the functionality of the app by building out the animal model to further enhance the app.
Add custom SASS styling with corresponding Gulp tasks to compile.
Display of the total number of caretakers needed in a day.
Add a property that records when each animal was admitted. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.
Expand the application to differentiate between animals' species. Group the animals into those categories. Then include a component to display the total needed caretakers for whichever species the user selects.
Add a new master component to average the total age for each species.
Show animals based on diet type. Then, show all animals who eat meat (carnivores AND omnivores)
